        <h1>What is The Blood Drive</h1>
        <p>
                The Blood Drive is a non-profit social movement which is providing a “platform” to those searching for blood and are unable to buy or get a blood donor timely.
                 It enables a blood seeker to easily contact blood donors in their nearby area by a single call or text. 
                 Approximately 19000 people have so far joined this social movement from throughout Pakistan and are helping in saving lives in their specific areas.
                In case, you are searching for blood donor, then download “Blood Community App” from Google Play and App Store.
        </p>
        <h1 class="1"> Blood Donation in Africa </h1>
        <p>
            In Africa, blood and blood products are indispensable within health care service delivery systems because of their
             contribution in saving the lives of patients who have lost blood through surgery, hemorrhage, labor and injury or in situations in 
             which the body is unable to produce sufficient blood due to an illness.1 Lack of or delay in timely administration (blood transfusion) of blood has contributed to preventable deaths.
             2 However, universal access to safe blood for patients in need of blood transfusion therapy remains a major problem in many African countries due to the challenge of blood shortage.
            Even when people donate blood, the blood is unsafe due to the high prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) among the donors.
            3 One of the main reasons why health systems are experiencing blood shortage in Africa is the fact that many people are reluctant to donate blood for many reasons, including the fear of getting transmissible infections.
            4 While a global estimate of 80 million units of blood is donated worldwide, only two million units are donated in sub-Saharan Africa where there is a great need for blood transfusion, triggered by factors such as malnutrition, maternal morbidity and many other infectious diseases like malaria.
            2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
            about eight million units of blood are required for a population of close to 800 million people in need of blood transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa.3
        </p>
        <h1 class="2">Importance of Blood Donation System</h1>
        <p>Along with helping save lives, there are a number of reasons why donating blood is important.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A single donation can save three lives. One blood donation provides different blood components that can help up to three different people.</li>
            <li>Blood cannot be manufactured. Despite medical and technological advances,
                 blood cannot be made, so donations are the only way we can give blood to those who need it.</li>
            <li>Blood is needed every two seconds. Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused in the U.S. every year.</li>
            <li>Only 37 percent of the country’s population is able to donate blood.</li>
            <li>Your friends or family may need your blood someday.</li>
        </ol>
